<h3> ABOUT IT...  </h3>

<p>The Lotus Temple, located in New Delhi, India, is a Bahá'í House of Worship completed in 1986. Notable 
for its flowerlike shape, it serves as the Mother Temple of the Indian subcontinent and has become a prominent
attraction in the city. The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards
and been featured in hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles</p>



<p> Since its inauguration to public worship and visits in December 1986, the Bahá’í House of Worship in New Delhi, 
India has drawn to its portals more than 70 million visitors, making it one of the most visited edifices in the world.
On an average, 8,000 to 10,000 people visit the Bahá’í House
of Worship each day. These visitors have admired its universal design in the form of a lotus and have been fascinated
by the Teachings of the Bahá’í Faith, especially its tenets of the Oneness of God, the Oneness of Religions, and the 
Oneness of Mankind.

This Bahá’í House of Worship of the Indian subcontinent joins six other Bahá’í Houses of Worship around the world:
Apia, Western Samoa; Sydney, Australia; Kampala, Uganda; Panama City, Panama; Frankfurt, Germany; Wilmette, USA.
Each of these Houses of Worship, while sharing some basic design concepts, has its own distinct cultural identity
embodying the principle of unity in diversity.</p>
